# Robot-Code
It is very long because it consists many useless or unused codes. 
I tried to categorize and indent the functions, so that if you paste the code directly into VEX V5 Pro, you can expand and collapse them

Things to change before competition: 
1. line 790, which auton program to use
2. line 396, 449 or 484, which color you are on
3. comment out some parts if they are unnecessary
4. write what you did on line 776, just to double check

Or, if you want, you can make them separate programs, but I don't think there are enough slots to hold every condition. 

Refrence: https://github.com/cmwade/Caldwell-2020/blob/master/Caldwell-2020-Code/src/odom.cpp. You can also copy their method of choosing the auton program through the controller.
